The kChat app requires an Infomaniak account with kSuite which requires a subscription (infomaniak.com/ksuite). It enables you to communicate live with your teams and organise your projects within a unified communication platform.

kChat is available on all devices. It means you can keep in touch with your teams and projects wherever you are.

With the kChat app, you can:

- Communicate with your teams and organise your conversations via public or private channels.
- Send messages and files or make audio/video calls with one person, a group of people or an entire public or private channel.
- Mention people in conversations to get their attention.
- Quickly see the conversations in which you’re mentioned.
- See at a glance the messages you’ve saved.
- Easily search for a conversation and specific files.
- Customise notifications to remain focused on the essentials.
- Insert gifs, emojis and animations to add fun and emotion when words aren’t enough.
