# kChat Mobile

kChat is a fork of Mattermost mobile adapted for use within the Infomaniak ecosystem.

While the mobile app is a fork of Mattermost, the back-end is custom made and entierely developped by Infomaniak.

The kChat app requires an Infomaniak account with kSuite. It enables you to communicate live with your teams and organise your projects within a unified communication platform.
