export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/include"
```

## Contribution

If you wish to contribute code to the Mattermost base repository to fix issues or add new features, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A valid GitHub account.
- Been added to the Infomaniak GitHub group.

### Steps:

1. First, add two remote repositories to your local GitHub folder using the following commands:

   - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile.git` (used to pull the latest changes from upstream)
   - `git remote add fork https://github.com/Infomaniak/mobile-kchat.git` (used to create the PR onto upstream)

2. Next, pull the main upstream branch to ensure you have the latest changes from upstream.

3. Once you have cloned the upstream branch in your projects, switch to this branch using `git checkout {name of the branch}`.

4. Create your own local branch from the upstream branch using `git checkout -b {name of the branch}`.

5. After applying your changes, push them to the remote fork to create a PR on Mattermost using `git push fork {name of the branch}`.

6. Follow the PR instructions to provide Mattermost with the necessary information to review your code thoroughly.
